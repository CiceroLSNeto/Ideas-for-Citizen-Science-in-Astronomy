\begin{abstract} 

We review the relatively new, internet-enabled, and rapidly evolving field of
citizen science, focusing on ideas from which astronomy either has benefited, or
could benefit in the future. We consider contributions to science in the form of
observations, instrumentation, data processing, data modeling and the design of
new scientific inquiries. Engaging a large and diverse community of both
professionals and citizens, we digest and present their suggestions for ideas
for citizen astronomy in the future. The limits to this approach to scientific
investigation are not yet known, but we make some rough estimates for astronomy
in particular.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The term ``Citizen Science'' refers to the activities of people who are not paid
to carry out scientific research, but nevertheless make intellectual
contributions to scientific research in their spare time. These contributions
are diverse, both in type and research area. The people who make those
contributions can, and do, come from all walks of life. This review is about the
science projects they have participated in to date, the tasks they have
performed, and how astronomy has benefited -- and could benefit further -- from
their efforts.

Citizen involvement in science pre-dates the profession itself, and there is a
long and honourable tradition of amateur observers making important discoveries
and significant sustained contributions. However, the advent of the world wide
web has changed the face of professional and amateur collaboration, providing
new opportunities and accelerating the sharing of information. People are now
connected to each other in a way that has never happened before. Professional
scientists can interact with citizens via a range of web-based media, including
purpose-built citizen science websites which increase the potential for shared
data analysis and exploration as well as data collection. Meanwhile, communities
of citizens have sprung into existence as like-minded people have been able to
find and talk to each other in a way that is almost independent of their
geographical location. The result has been an exponential increase in citizen
involvement in science. The field is evolving very quickly, with more and more
professional scientists becoming aware of the possibilities offered by
collaborating with, for example, specialists operating outside the usual
parameters of professional astronomical observation, or tens of thousands of
people eager to perform analysis in their lunch hours via microtasking.  Our aim
in this review is to review the scientific literature as it stands for ideas
implemented in citizen science projects, primarily in astronomy but also in
other fields, and then produce a summary of successful project characteristics
for future research groups to learn from.

As our title states, this is a review of ideas for astronomy. We will look
forward as well as back, and try to answer the questions: How can the full
potential of citizen science be realised in astronomy? What are the particular
niches that citizen science can fill, in our field? How might it contribute to
the solutions of the Big Data problem in astronomy?

% Somewhat in the spirit of citizen science, we are crowd-sourcing these
% questions via a blog, \stellarpops, set up to accompany this article.  Each
% area we cover will be opened up for discussion in the comments section, and we
% are encouraging the leading proponents to join in that discussion. Likewise,
% we are encouraging involvement from the citizens already working in astronomy,
% and the  community of astronomers collaborating with them. The result will be
% an open conversation which we will distill, with appropriate acknowledgment,
% into these pages.
% 
% \BLOG{1}{Phil}{What's all this about?}

This review is organised as follows. We survey the contributions to science that
citizens have made to date, organized according to the stage of the scientific
enquiry that those contributions fell into. Astronomy research typically starts
with observations: so do we, in \Sref{sec:obs}. We then proceed through a
discussion of citizen instrumentation, data processing, data modeling and
finally citizen-led enquiry in 
Sections~\ref{sec:instr}--\ref{sec:explore}. With this overview in place,
we review in \Sref{sec:crowd} the literature on, and the collected experience
of, the population of citizens who have taken part, or are currently taking
part, in scientific research, before summarizing progress in citizen science to
date in \Sref{sec:summary}. In the second part of this review, we turn to the
future. We first report a variety of suggestions for how
citizens might contribute to astronomy there in \Sref{sec:future}. Then, in 
\Sref{sec:limits} we consider possible limits to citizen science, including
challenges associated with data rates and volumes, data complexity, the
difficulties of large-scale collaboration, and finally the barriers to
accessibility. Finally, we give some concluding remarks in
\Sref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{Data Acquisition: Citizen Observing}
\label{sec:obs}

Typically, data in astronomy is aquired with some sort of telescope. In the 21st
century there certainly is an active community of well-equipped amateur
observers making observations of great utility. There are also many other
citizens observing the night sky with less sophisticated equipement, and/or less
enthusiasm -- and as we shall see, there are plenty of citizens making 
astronomical observations almost inadvertently. What astronomical data are the
citizenry taking, and what is it being used for?

\subsection{Passive Observing (\textbf{Phil}, Chris)}
\label{sec:obs:passive}

While amateur astronomers have aquired a great deal of very useful data, the
general population is better equipped than ever to image the sky and make that
data available for scientific analysis. This has been demonstrated by two
recent professionally-led studies, that made use of a largely passive
observing community connected via online social networks not usually
associated with astronomy. 

\CaseStudy{The Orbit of Comet Holmes from the Photographs Uploaded to Flickr.}
\citet{Lang++2011} used N images scraped from the photo sharing website Flickr
as inputs to a reconstruction of the orbit of Comet Holmes. This comet was
bright enough to be visible with the naked eye in XX, 20XX, and a large number
of photographs were taken of it, and uploaded to the Flickr site.
\citeauthor{Lang++2011} were able to astrometrically calibrate the images that
contained enough detectable stars in the background using their automatic
image registration software, \texttt{astrometry.net}. This had been enabled as
a Flickr ``bot,'' crawling over all images submitted to the
\texttt{astrometry.net} group and sending the photos' owners messages showing
them where on the sky their images were taken. The calibrated images trace out
the trajectory of the comet over N nights, allowing a refinement of the
comet's orbit of ... As the authors point out ...  While in this case the
photographers did not realize they were participating in a scientific study,
the potential of combining powerful calibration software with large amounts of
citizen-supplied imaging data is made clear. 


\CaseStudy{Detecting Meteor Showers with Twitter.}
By saving a nightly (?) log of all tweets submitted to the web service
Twitter, \citet{Barentsen++2010} were able to 
detect several new meteor showers simply by searching for the text string
``meteor.'' Unwitting naked-eye observers had spotted shooting stars and
tweeted about them, giving rise to a detectable signal in the steam of tweets
that night. The detected sample is incomplete/unlocalised/ etc... However,
this work illustrates the potential both of Twitter as a communication system
for connecting large numbers of observers with a science team, and of networks
of unequipped observers for doing very bright object transient astronomy.

\section{Data Acquisition: Citizen Instrumentation}
\label{sec:instr}

The observations described in the previous section were typically made with the
citizens' own equipment; in many cases, just as with professional astronomers,
the science contributed to is driven by the available technology.  This citizen
instrumentation has in some case become quite advanced,  as a result of the
citizens own customisation work.

\section{Data Processing}
\label{sec:class}

Building, instrumenting and maintaining a telescope, and then observing the
night sky with it, are perhaps the most familiar activities to amateur
astronomers. Professional astronomers spend far longer working with the data
they have taken after their observing run, reducing and exploring images and
spectra, and detecting and characterising objects and features. This data
processing phase is an essential part of the scientific process; it results in a
set of summary statistics or descriptors of the data, that can be more
conveniently propagated through to the interpretation phase. That is, data
processing involves distillation of data into knowledge -- but stops short of
the generation of understanding. What sorts of data processing have citizens
been actively engaged in? We include the word ``actively'' here, to
differentiate between the data processing that astronomers carry out, and 
computing jobs that can be farmed out to grids of computers owned by citizens.

\subsection{Visual Classification in Astronomy (\textbf{Chris}, Phil)}
\label{sec:class:astro}

Visual classification holds something of a central position in astronomy: there
is a strong historical tradition of astronomers asking, ``What's that?'' in
response to a new observation, and the first answer is usually (and most
usefully) descriptive, rather than explanatory. In the internet age,
classification of features in images, spectra and time series can be carried out
at enormous scale by crowds of citizens with web browsers. Such web interfaces
have come to be known as ``zoos,'' after the first project to engage crowds in
this way, Galaxy Zoo. Just as in a zoological park, the visitors are shown
various example specimens, and invited to consider what those specimens might
be. At the Galaxy Zoo, the visitors are asked to go one step further, and are
presented with a questionnaire about each specimen they see.


Case studies:
\begin{itemize}
\item Galaxy morphology with Galaxy Zoo
\item Surfaces of solar system bodies: Moon Zoo, Moonwatch. Saturn storms. JUPOS
measurers.
\item Time domain astronomy: Supernova Zoo, PlanetHunters
\item Rapid-reaction events (jovian/lunar impacts, storm/plume eruptions)
\item Data mining for asteroids and TNOs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Visual Classification in Other Fields (\textbf{Chris}, Phil)}
\label{sec:class:non-astro}

There is now a diverse range of zoo-like citizen science portals online,
covering social as well as natural sciences. What can we learn from visual
classification projects outside astronomy?

\begin{itemize}
\item Annotation in Ancient Lives
\item etc.

\subsection{Image Processing (\textbf{Leigh}, Phil)}
\label{sec:class:non-sensory}

Visual classification is by no means the only activity in which citizens have
been participating. What else have people been up to, turning raw data in to
knowledge?

Case studies:
\begin{itemize}
\item Jupiter: lucky imaging
\item Mars rover images.

\section{Data Modeling: Citizen Analysts}
\label{sec:model}

New understanding of the world comes from the interpretation of data, in the
context of a model. The modeling activity itself often has technical
difficulties that computers may find hard to overcome, associated with complex
and/or computationally expensive, likelihood functions. Humans, by applying
their developed intuition, can often contribute a great deal to the exploration
of a model's parameter space by closing in quickly on the model configurations
that are fit the data well. This process can be particularly satisfying,
rather like solving a puzzle. How have citizen scientists been involved in
model making and fitting?

\section{Data Exploration: Citizen Enquiry}
\label{sec:explore}

The previous sections have focused on specific, and isolated, activities in
which citizens have participated. In most cases, the community's involvement has
been a {\it contribution} to a scientific investigation, while not being
involved in the design of the investigation. The most important part of any
scientific investigation is the question at the heart of it: what is it we are
trying to find out about the world? In this section we look at some cases where
the process of enquiry, the science, has been instigated or led by citizens.  In
principle, this is an area of great potential. Professional scientists can find
it very difficult to step back from the technical details of their work, and see
the bigger picture; in contrast, outsiders only see the big picture, and  so we
might expect them to ask some unusual, surprising and searching questions.

We have argued that a critical part of `citizen science' lies in the ability of
the amateur to make an authentic contribution to science. Earlier in this part
of the review, we looked forward to a richer future for such interaction, but in
this section we consider the potential limits and checks on citizen science.
