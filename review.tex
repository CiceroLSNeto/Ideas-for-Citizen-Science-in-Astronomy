\begin{abstract} 

We review the relatively new, internet-enabled, and rapidly evolving field of
citizen science, focusing on projects in astronomy and solar system science but
sampling beyond those fields. In doing so, we look for  ideas from which
astronomy  could benefit in the future. We consider contributions to science in
the form of observations, data processing, data modeling and the design of new
scientific inquiries, and from this experience derive some commonalities between
the most successful projects, and use them to suggest some guidelines for future
projects. The limits of citizen science are not yet well understood, but we make
some speculations for citizen astronomy in particular.

\section{Introduction (2 pages)}
\label{sec:intro}

The term ``citizen science'' refers to the activities of people who are not paid
to carry out scientific research, but who make intellectual contributions to
scientific research nonetheless.\footnote{In this review we differentiate
between the data analysis that citizens carry out themselves, and  distributed
``grid'' computing farmed out to computers owned by citizens, and omit the
latter since it does not fit our definition of citizen science as involving
intellectual  contributions from citizens.} They come from all walks of life,
and their contributions are diverse, both in type and research area. This review
is about the science projects they have participated in to date, the tasks they
have performed, and how astronomy has benefited -- and could benefit further --
from their efforts.

Citizen involvement in science pre-dates the profession itself; the earliest
example of collaboration between professional and amateur astronomers seems to
have been Edmund Halley's call for observations of the 1715 total eclipse of the
Sun which crossed central England \citep{Halley}.\footnote{The aim was to refine
estimates of the size of the shadow cast by the Moon, and citizen observations
were much needed. Although Halley was successful in observing, his colleagues at
Oxford were clouded out, and those in Cambridge were ``oppressed by too much
Company, so that, though the heavens were very favourable, [they] missed both
the time of the beginning of the Eclipse and that of total darkness.''}  Since
then there has since been a long and honourable tradition of amateur observers
making important discoveries and significant sustained contributions. However,
the advent of the world wide web has changed the face of professional and
amateur collaboration, providing new opportunities and accelerating the sharing
of information. People are now connected to each other on a scale that has never
happened before. Professional scientists can interact with citizens via a range
of web-based media, including on purpose-built citizen science websites which
increase the potential for shared data analysis and exploration, as well as for
data collection. Meanwhile, communities of citizens have sprung into existence
as like-minded people have been able to find and talk to each other in a way
that is almost independent of their geographical location. The result has been
an exponential increase in citizen involvement in science. The field is evolving
very quickly, with more and more professional scientists becoming aware of the
possibilities offered by collaborating with, for example, specialists operating
outside the usual parameters of professional astronomical observation, or tens
of thousands of people eager to perform microtasks in their spare time.  

Our aim in this work is to review the scientific literature as it stands for
ideas implemented in citizen science projects, primarily in astronomy but
occasionally in other fields, and then produce a summary of successful project
characteristics for future research groups to learn from.  As our title states,
this is a review of ideas for astronomy. We will look forward as well as back,
and try to answer the questions: How can the full potential of citizen science
be realised in astronomy? What are the particular niches that citizen science
can fill, in our field? How might it contribute to the solutions of the Big Data
problem in astronomy?


This review is organised as follows. Astronomy research typically starts
with observations: so do we, in \Sref{sec:obs}. We then proceed to consider 
visual classification, data modeling and finally citizen-led enquiry in 
Sections~\ref{sec:class}--\ref{sec:explore}. With this overview in place, we
review in \Sref{sec:crowd} the literature on, and the collected experience of,
the population of citizens who have taken part, or are currently taking part, in
scientific research. We then turn to the future, and speculate on how citizens
might contribute to astronomy there (\Sref{sec:future}); in  \Sref{sec:limits}
we consider possible limits to citizen science, including challenges associated
with data rates and volumes, data complexity, the difficulties of large-scale
collaboration, and the barriers to accessibility. Finally, we make some
concluding remarks in \Sref{sec:conclusions}, and suggest some guidelines for
the implementation of future citizen science projects in astronomy.

\section{Amateur Observing (5 pages)}
\label{sec:obs}

There is currently an active community of well-equipped amateur observers making
astronomical observations of great utility. There are also many other citizens
observing the night sky with less sophisticated equipment -- and as we shall
see, there are even citizens making  astronomical observations almost
inadvertently. What astronomical data are the citizenry taking, and what is it
being used for?

\subsection{Active Observing (3 pages)}
\label{sec:obs:active}

The steady improvements and increasing affordability of digital technology, in
addition to the ease of data sharing and communications, have considerably
expanded the realm of amateur astronomy in the past two decades.  
% Observers have always been passionate about their pastime, from painstakingly
% recorded hand drawings of the planets and their positions in the night sky, to
% hours devoted to the monitoring and tracking of astronomical events.  There is a
% long and proud history of contributions from ``amateurs'' to the field, driven
% by a desire to share the results of their hobby with others, but it has only
% been in the past few decades that mechanisms have been in place that enable the
% sharing of large amounts of data between amateurs and professionals, enticing
% passionate observers to shape their observations to address scientific
% questions.  
In this section, we review some of the citizen contributions to active
observations of the night sky.  ``Passive'' contributions 
will be described in Sections~\ref{sec:obs:passive} below.

How is active citizen observing beneficial to astronomy research?  The first
key advantage is time availability: professional observatories are always
over-subscribed, with resources ending up being concentrated on one area of
sky, or on a few astronomical questions.  Such observations are rarely tuned
to the optimum timescales for other scientific enquiries. For example,
determinations of meteor frequencies on short timescales (minutes), or slow
evolution of giant planets on longer timescales (years and decades).  In
contrast, amateur observations can be frequent, repetitive, and long standing,
and are naturally well sampled across the globe during an exciting event of
interest. 

The second, related, advantage is that of flexibility: whenever a new phenomenon
is discovered (e.g., a new comet, or anything changing the appearance of the
familiar planetary discs), observers will be keen to catch a glimpse
irrespective of the scientific value of their observations.  This reaction can
be near instantaneous, compared to the need to allocate telescope resources
among the professional community.  

The third benefit is contextual.  Professional observations often are taken in a
very different wavelength range, focus on a narrower spatial region, or employ
spectroscopic techniques that don't yield images. In some situations,
near-simultaneous wide field optical imaging by citizen scientists can provide
useful additional constraints on the process of interest.

The example case studies below serve to illustrate this synergy between amateur
and professional observations, and also to highlight instances of
professional-amateur (``Pro-Am'') collaboration. While the solar system provides
some of the most amenable targets for amateur observation, ``deep sky''
observations by the non-professional community provide important further insight
into the capabilities and potential of citizen astronomers.

% Solar System Observations

\CaseStudy{Discovery and characterisation of Asteroids and Comets}
Although survey telescopes provide the vast majority of modern solar system
discoveries, citizen astronomers occupy some useful observational niches.  Small
solar system objects moving against the fixed-star background can be detected in
a set of CCD frames either by eye or by automated software. Targets include
near-earth asteroids (NEAs, with orbits intersecting those of the terrestrial
planets), main belt asteroids between Mars and Jupiter, and comets making their
journey towards the Sun from the outer solar system. The extreme familiarity of
citizen astronomers with a particular region, planet or nebula, allows them to
immediately identify peculiarities or new features.  A protocol for citizen
discovery has been established: the position of any new object is compared to
existing catalogues, and if no existing details are found then the new discovery
and its ephemerides can be reported to the IAU Minor Planet
Centre\footnote{http://www.minorplanetcenter.net}.   If observations are
repeated for at least two nights by one or several observers, then a new
denomination is provisionally assigned to the discovery.   An electronic
circular then reports the discovery to the wider world.  For example, the NEA
2012 DA14 was initially reported to the Minor Planet Centre by a team of amateur
observers affiliated with the La Sagra Sky Survey at the Astronomical
Observatory (Spain), and characterised by professional astronomers during its
closest approach in February 2013 \citep[e.g., ][]{13deleon}.

As with asteroids, the majority of new comet discoveries are made by automated
surveys, but a small and stable number of discoveries come from amateurs with
small telescopes, typically in regions poorly covered by survey telescopes
(e.g., regions close to the Sun).   C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy), a Kreutz sungrazer
comet, is one such example discovered by T. Lovejoy and circulated via the
Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (CBAT) \citep[e.g.,][]{12sekanina}. 
The Oort cloud comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) was spotted by V. Nevski and A. Novichonok
in images from the International Scientific Optical Network, which spurred a
major international effort to observe its perihelion passage as it disintegrated
\citep{14sekanina}.  Amateurs are also contributing to the search for a
sub-category of objects with a detectable cometary coma within the asteroid
belt.  Recent discoveries of these Main Belt Comets, which appear to be
asteroids that are actively venting their volatiles at perihelion, are beginning
to blur the distinction between asteroids and comets.  The T3 project, a
collaboration between the University of Rome and several amateur observers,
began in 2005 with the detection of a coma around asteroid 2005 SB216
\citep{06buzzi}, and has gone on to detect at least eight main belt comets
\citep{14mousis_proam}.  These early citizen science discoveries, followed up by
professional astronomers, have generated new insights into the properties and
variety of comets.  In some cases, such as the discovery of Comet Shoemaker-Levy
9 (co-discovered by amateur observer D. Levy) before its collision with Jupiter
\citep{04harrington}, these discoveries revealed the dynamic and evolving nature
of our solar system.

Beyond first detections, citizen observers can aid in the detailed
characterisation of physical and orbital characteristics of these newly
discovered solar system bodies, and amateur-led contributions are published via
the \textit{Minor Planet
Bulletin}\footnote{http://www.minorplanet.info/mpbdownloads.html}.  Photometric
monitoring of an asteroid as it rotates provides information on the physical
parameters, such as the shape, rotation rate and orientation; whereas monitoring
of a comet's coma, dust and plasma tails can reveal dynamic structures,determine
the locations of active venting regions and reveal outbursts and other events
associated with the outgassing \citep[see][for a comprehensive
review]{14mousis_proam}.  In this case study, it is the global distribution of
citizen observers and their long-baselines of observations that can yield new
discoveries of minor bodies in our solar system.

\CaseStudy{Planetary monitoring over long timescales}
Planetary atmospheres make tantalising targets for citizen observers, being
large, bright, colourful and highly variable from night to night (e.g., Fig.
\ref{fig:planets}.  The long-term monitoring provided by the network of amateur
astronomers provide valuable insights into the meteorology and climate of these
worlds, tracking the motions of clouds, waves and storms as they are transported
by atmospheric winds to probe the physical and chemical processes shaping their
climates.  For example, the global distribution of giant planet observers
permits global monitoring of Jupiter and Saturn as they rotate over 10 hours.
Citizens upload raw filtered images and colour composites, organised by date and
time, to online servers, such as the Planetary Virtual Observatory and
Laboratory (PVOL\footnote{\texttt{http://www.pvol.ehu.es/pvol}}) maintained for
the International Outer Planets Watch \citep[IOPW][]{10hueso}.  Those images can
be used by amateurs and professionals alike to quantitatively study the zoology
of activity; from measuring wind speeds from erupting plumes \citep{08sanchez};
investigating the strength and changes to the large vortices \citep[e.g., the
2006 reddening of Jupiter's Oval BA,][]{06simon-miller}; to determining the life
cycle of the belt/zone structure \citep{96sanchez, 11fletcher_fade}.  For
Saturn, a close collaboration between citizen scientists and Cassini spacecraft
scientists has allowed correlation of lightning-related radio emissions detected
by the spacecraft with visible cloud structures on the disc (known as Saturn
Storm Watch) \citep[e.g.,][]{11fischer}, which would not be possible with the
targeted regional views provided by Cassini's cameras alone. Furthermore, it was
the amateur community that first spotted the eruption of Saturn's enormous
2010-2011 storm system, which was monitored over several months
\citep{12sanchez}.

Video monitoring has been used to enable high resolution ``lucky'' imaging of
Jupiter: the best images at moments of clear seeing from the high-resolution
video frames are selected, extracted and stacked together, using custom software
to correct for the distortions associated with the telescope optics and residual
atmospheric seeing.  Software written by citizen scientists for free
distribution to active observers, such as
Registax\footnote{www.astronomie.be/registax} and
Autostakkert\footnote{www.autostakkert.com},  allows them to process their own
video files, thus avoiding the need for transfer and storage of large datasets
on some centralised server \citep[see][for a thorough review]{14mousis_proam}. 
Descriptive records of morphological changes are maintained and continuously
updated by organisations of citizen scientists such as the British Astronomical
Association (BAA) and the Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers (ALPO).
The BAA's Jupiter section\footnote{http://www.britastro.org/jupiter/} is a team
of amateurs with substantial expertise in Jupiter's appearance
\citep{95rogers};  their regular bulletins describe the changing appearance of
the banded structure, the emergence of new turbulent structures and weather
phenomena, and keep a record of the long-term atmospheric changes.  

Active citizen observing also provides long-term monitoring in the inner solar
system.  Venus' photochemical smog shields the planet's surface from view, but
discrete cloud features can be used to study the super-rotation of the Venusian
atmosphere and the occurrence of a mysterious ultraviolet absorber high in the
planet's atmosphere (i.e., using near-UV filters).  For example, the Venus
Ground-Based Image Active Archive was created by ESA to provide contextual
observations supporting the Venus Express mission \citep{08barentsen}.  The
Martian atmosphere, with its ephemeral clouds, seasonal CO2 polar ice cycles and
dust storms, continues to prove popular among citizen observers, although these
typically supplement the wealth of high-resolution information being returned by
orbital and surface missions to the red planet.  As with other planetary
targets, amateur observations provide the long temporal records for the
evolution of atmospheric features.  Groups such as the International Society of
Mars Observers
(ISMO\footnote{\texttt{http://www.mars.dti.ne.jp/~cmo/ISMO.html}}), the British
Astronomical Association (BAA) and the International Mars Watch program
quantitatively and qualitatively assess these amateur images.  Finally, although
citizen observations of Uranus and Neptune are in their infancy and require
telescopes with diameters exceeding 25 cm, there have been confirmed reports of
atmospheric banding and discrete cloud features when near-infrared filters are
used to maximise contrast between white clouds and the background and long
exposure times of tens of minutes.  Citizen monitoring of all of these worlds
(summarised in Fig. \ref{fig:planets}) provides the long-baselines, flexibility
and high frequency of imaging needed to understand the forces shaping their
evolving climates.

\CaseStudy{Transient Events and Meteor Detection}
The increasing adoption of video monitoring of planetary targets means that
unexpected, short-lived events are now more likely to be observed by citizen
astronomers than by professional observatories.  For example, an impact scar
near Jupiter's south polar region was first discovered in imaging by Australian
amateur Anthony Wesley on July 19th, 2009, and led to an international campaign
of professional observations to understand the asteroidal collision that had
created the scar \citep[e.g.,][]{10hammel,10depater,11orton}.  Although the 2009
impact was out of view from the Earth, at least three flashes have been
confirmed between 2010 and 2012, and the light curves used to determine the
sizes and frequency of objects colliding with Jupiter \citep[e.g.,][]{10hueso}
(\Fref{fig:jupiter-impacts}).  Citizen scientists have developed free software
to allow observers to search for impact flashes in an automated way (e.g.,
Jupiter impact detections\footnote{http://www.pvol.ehu.es/software/} and
LunarScan from the ALPO Lunar Meteoritic Impact Search for transient impact
flashes recorded on the moon
\footnote{http://alpo-astronomy.org/lunarupload/lunimpacts.htm}).  

% Closer to home, transient impact flashes due to lunar impacts have been
% recorded by video monitoring of the non-illuminated fraction of the Moon,
% aiming to determine the impact hazard at the lunar surface.  These
% quantitative studies of impacts in the Earth-Moon system allow scientists to
% understand the meteoritic streams threading our solar system; identify
% previously unrecognised meteor showers; and determine the statistics of
% potentially hazardous encounters with this extra-terrestrial material.   

Closer to home, citizen scientists play a crucial role in the recording of rare
and unpredictable events such as the fireballs from meteoroid impacts, such as
the February 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor \citep{13popova}.  Video footage of the
fireball and shockwave were essential to scientifically characterise the
impactor and its likely origins, despite that fact that these records were
largely captured accidentally by autonomous security cameras.  Trajectories
reconstructed from these records even permit the recovery of meteorites from a
debris field (i.e., when the meteor survives the intense heat of atmospheric
entry and reaches the ground).  These objects are the remnant debris left over
from the epoch of planetary formation, and fragments left over from comets and
asteroids, so their numbers, sizes and composition provide a window onto the
earliest evolutionary stages of our solar system.  The statistics of these
impacts reveal the risk of threats in our local neighbourhood, and these
statistics are currently provided via a global network of citizen scientists,
sharing and publicising their observations of meteors via the International
Meteor Organisation (IMO\footnote{\texttt{http://www.imo.net}}).

\CaseStudy{Exoplanet Transits.} Beyond our solar system, amateurs have
contributed to exoplanetary transit discoveries,  attempting to measure the 1\%
diminution in starlight as a giant planet transits in front of its parent star.
\citet{13mousis} points out three methods where amateurs can contribute to
characterising exoplanetary systems ? (i) by frequent observations of known
transits to refine ephemeris; (ii) searching for transit time variations that
can reveal additional planets in a system; and (iii) searching for previously
unidentified transits in known planetary systems \citep[e.g., the discovery of
the transit of HD 80606b from a 30 cm telescope near London,][]{09fossey}.

\subsection{Passive Observing (1 page)}
\label{sec:obs:passive}

While amateur astronomers have aquired a great deal of very useful data, the
general population is better equipped than ever to image the sky and make that
data available for scientific analysis. This has been demonstrated by two
recent professionally-led studies, that made use of a largely passive
observing community connected via online social networks not usually
associated with astronomy. 

\CaseStudy{The Orbit of Comet Holmes from the Photographs Uploaded to Flickr.}
\citet{Lang++2011} used more than 2000 images scraped from the photo sharing website Flickr
as inputs to a reconstruction of the orbit of Comet Holmes. This comet was
bright enough to be visible with the naked eye during its 2007 apparition, and a large number
of photographs were taken of it and uploaded to the Flickr site.
\citeauthor{Lang++2011} were able to astrometrically calibrate many of the images using their automatic
image registration software, \texttt{astrometry.net}, which relies on background stars. This had been enabled as
a Flickr ``bot,'' crawling over all images submitted to the
\texttt{astrometry.net} group and sending the photos' owners messages showing
them where on the sky their images were taken.  The time of observation could in many cases be derived from metadata included in the image headers. The calibrated images trace out
the trajectory of the comet, producing a result which is close to that obtained from the JPL Horizons system \citep{Giorgini}. Estimates of orbital parameters from Flickr images alone are accurate, when compared to the Horizons values, to within a few standard deviations. As the authors point out, while in this case the
photographers did not realize they were participating in a scientific study,
the potential of combining powerful calibration software with large amounts of
citizen-supplied imaging data is made clear. This method of `unconscious' citizen science may prove to have significant value in fields beyond astronomy too - if models of statistical sampling can be developed - with ecological surveys of images submitted to sites like Flickr likely in the next few years. 

\CaseStudy{Detecting Meteor Showers with Twitter.}
By saving a nightly (?) log of all tweets submitted to the web service
Twitter, \citet{Barentsen++2010} were able to 
detect several new meteor showers simply by searching for the text string
``meteor.'' Unwitting naked-eye observers had spotted shooting stars and
tweeted about them, giving rise to a detectable signal in the steam of tweets
that night. The detected sample is incomplete/unlocalised/ etc... However,
this work illustrates the potential both of Twitter as a communication system
for connecting large numbers of observers with a science team, and of networks
of unequipped observers for doing very bright object transient astronomy.

\section{Visual Classification (6 pages)}
\label{sec:class}

Observing the night sky with a telescope is perhaps the most familiar of the
activities of amateur astronomers, but as the previous section showed, citizens
are also actively involved in the processing and interpretation of the data they
have taken.  In this and the next section we look at projects where much larger
archival datasets are made available to crowds of citizens, who are asked to
inspect astronomical images, and help describe and characterize the features in
them. Despite significant advances in machine learning and computer vision, the
visual inspection of data remains an important part of astronomy, as it
continues to take advantage of the amazing human capacity for visual pattern
recognition. While many in the 1990s predicted that the increasing size of
astronomical datasets would make such time-intensive inspection impossible, the
extensive reach of the world wide web has enabled the involvement of hundreds of
thousands of citizen scientists in this form of ``crowd-sourced'' data
analysis.

\subsection{Visual Classification in Astronomy (3 pages)}
\label{sec:class:astro}

\CaseStudy{Stardust@home}
While significant preliminary work had been carried out by NASA's clickworkers
project (see below), the project that first illustrated the potential of
crowd-sourcing for astronomical purposes was Stardust@home\footnote{http://stardustathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/}. This effort, which
asked volunteers to scan through images of samples returned from Comet Wild-2
by the \emph{Stardust} mission, attracted a large audience to the apparently
unprepossessing task of looking for dust grains in an effort to identify
samples of material from outside our Solar System. The site was built on
BOSSA, an early attempt to build a generalized platform for such crowd-sourcing
projects (see next section), and featured a stringent test which had to be
passed before classifications were counted. Despite this hurdle, more than
20,000 people took part and a variety of dust grains were removed from the
aerogel for further study, at least one later proving an excellent candidate
for an interstellar grain. Perhaps the most significant long-term impact of
Stardust@home, though, was the demonstration that large amounts of volunteer
effort were available even for relatively `unsexy' tasks such as hunting dust
grains which do not involve intrinsically beautiful images, and that, with a
suitable website design and stringent testing, scientifically valuable results
could be obtained. 

\todo{Chris}{\#30 Add Stardust@home references, Stardust@home url as a footnote.}

\CaseStudy{Galaxy morphology with Galaxy Zoo} 
These results directly inspired the development of Galaxy Zoo, perhaps the most
prominent scientific crowd-sourcing project to date. Galaxy Zoo was built on the
continued importance of morphological classification of galaxies. First
introduced in a systematic fashion by Hubble, and later developed by amongst
others de Vaucoleurs, it remains the case that the morphology of a system is
closely related to -- but not entirely defined by -- parameters such as colour,
star formation history, dynamics, concentration and so on.  In an effort to
prepare for large surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), \citet{Lahav1995} and \citet{Lahav1996} followed especially by the work of \citet{Ball} developed neural networks
trained on small samples of expert classifications in order to automate the
process of classification,\footnote{The Lahav papers are perhaps as interesting
for their psychology as for their astrophysics, as the classifications reveal
the relations between the senior classifiers employed to be experts} arguing
that the size of the then up-coming surveys left no place for manual
classification.

\todo{Chris}{\#32 Add real refs for automatic morphology classification}

The performance of the automatic classifiers depended on the input parameters,
including colour, magnitude and size. These variables correlate well with
morphology, but are not themselves morphological, and when included they
dominate the classification. In particularly for galaxies which do not fit the
general trends, such as spirals with dominant bulges or star-forming
ellipticals, automated classifiers whether using these simple measures or more
complex proxies for morphology such as texture fail to match the performance
of expert classifiers. Schawinski \citep{Scha2007} and Nair \citep{Nair}, amongst others, spent substantial
time during their time as graduate students classifying tens of thousands of
galaxies. 

Inspired by Stardust@home, a group led by one of the authors (Lintott) created
Galaxy Zoo in 2007 to provide basic classifications of SDSS
galaxies\footnote{The original Galaxy Zoo is preserved at
\texttt{http://zoo1.galaxyzoo.org} with the current incarnation at
\texttt{http://www.galaxyzoo.org}.} Classifiers were presented with a coloured
image centered on and scaled to one of more than 800,000 galaxies, and could
select from one of six options: clockwise, anti clockwise and edge-on spirals,
ellipticals, mergers and ``star/don't know.'' Aside from  an easily-passed
initial test, little knowledge was required or indeed presented to classifiers,
enabling them to proceed quickly doing something real soon after arriving at the
site; this approach, in contrast to Stardust@home where a difficult test needed
to be completed before authentic and useful contributions could be made, was
successful in encouraging large numbers of visitors to participate. This tactic
-- in which both passing and sustained engagement provide substantial
contribution -- is illustrated in \Fref{}  which shows results from Galaxy Zoo
2. 
\todo{Chris}{\#34 Insert box diagram illustrating Zooniverse tactics / GZ2 results.} 
This later version of the project asked for more detailed
classifications via a decision tree containing questions such as `How prominent
is the bulge?', and later iterations of the project have applied a similar
approach to galaxies drawn from \emph{Hubble Space Telescope} surveys including
\textsc{GEMS, GOODS, COSMOS} and \textsc{CANDELS}. 

\todo{Chris}{\#35 Add galaxy zoo participation statistics}. 

These figures are undoubtedly impressive, but they would be meaningless if the
classifications provided were not suitable for science. With sufficient effort
to ensure each galaxy is classified multiple times (as many as 80 for many
Galaxy Zoo images), these independent classifications need to be combined into a
consensus. As discussed in later sections, this can become complex but for
Galaxy Zoo a simple weighting which rewards consistency, first described in
\citet{Land++}, was sufficient. \phil{By what criteria was it sufficient?}

\todo{Chris}{\#68 Check consistency between sections: there are lots of ``see below'' type statements in this section.}

Importantly, combining classifications provides not only the assignment of a
label but, in the vote fraction in a particular category, an indication of the
reliability of the classification. This allows more subtle biases, such as the
propensity for small, faint or distant galaxies to appear as elliptical
regardless of their true morphology, to be measured and accounted for (see
Bamford et al.). The net result is that the Galaxy Zoo classifications are an
excellent match for results from expert classification, and have produced
science ranging from studies of red spirals (Masters et al.) to investigations
of spiral spin (Slosar et al.).

\todo{Chris}{\#36 Let's back up the accuracy claims here with some citations and numbers.}

A full review of Galaxy Zoo science is beyond the scope of this review; a
recent summary is given in the Galaxy Zoo 2 data release paper by Willett et
al. However, it is worth noting that many of the project's most important
results have been the result not of interaction with the main interface but
represent rather serendipitous discoveries made by participants. We return to
these in \Sref{sec:explore} below.


\CaseStudy{Surfaces of solar system bodies: Moon Zoo, Moonwatch.}
If studying galaxies remains, at least in part, a visual pursuit, then the
same is certainly true of planetary science. NASA's clickworkers, which asked
volunteers to identify craters on the Martian surface, lays claim to be the
oldest astronomical crowd-sourcing project. The consensus results matched
those available from experts at the time, but failed to go beyond this
promising start to produce results of real scientific value. More recently,
interfaces inviting classifiers to look at the Moon, Mercury, Mars and Vesta
have been launched and attracted significant numbers of classifications, but
although preliminary results have been promising these projects have yet to
produce datasets that have been used by the planetary science community in the
same way that Galaxy Zoo has by the astronomical community. 

\todo{Chris}{\#38 Fact-check the consensus with experts claim about clickworkers, provide clickworkers reference.}

\todo{Chris}{\#69 Tidy up the multiple mentions of clickworkers. Whats the optimal ordering of these sections given their inter-references?}


\CaseStudy{Tracking Features in Giant Planet Atmospheres: WinJUPOS}
However, in \Sref{sec:obs:active} we described the observing strategies used by
the global network of citizen observers to monitor the appearance of planetary
atmospheres.  Recent software developments have provided a much more
quantitative perspective on these citizen observations. The WinJUPOS
software\footnote{http://jupos.privat.t-online.de/} was developed by a team of
citizen scientists led by G. Hahn and H.-J. Mettig. It allows multiple images of
a giant planet to be stacked with a correction for the rapid rotation of Jupiter
or Saturn  (once every 10 hours), then reprojected onto a latitude-longitude
coordinate system, so that the precise positional details of atmospheric
features can be determined via ``point-and-click,'' relying on the citizen's
ability to identify features on the planetary disc.  

By doing this over many nights surrounding Jupiter's opposition, the team
builds up enormous drift charts for these features (comprising tens of
thousands of positional measurements), ranging from the tiniest convective
structure being moved by the jet streams, to the largest vortices
\citep[e.g.][]{WinJUPOSRedSpot}.  The charts reveal the dynamic interactions
within the jovian weather layer, and the long-term stability of their zonal
jets (see e.g., the regular bulletins provided by the Jupiter section of the
British Astronomical Association). The positions can be extrapolated forward
in time, enabling targeted observations by professional observatories or even
visiting spacecraft (the Juno mission, scheduled to arrive at Jupiter in 2016,
is reliant on the citizen observer community to provide this sort of
contextual mapping for the close-in observations from the orbiting
spacecraft).  This long-term record of Jupiter's visible appearance by citizen
scientists has proven invaluable for jovian atmospheric scientists.

\todo{Phil}{Add references for where the WinJUPOS drift charts have been used

\CaseStudy{Time domain astronomy: Supernova Zoo and Planet Hunters}  \label{SNZoo} 
\citet{threeVs} describe the three ways -- volume, velocity and variety -- in
which the analysis of ``Big Data'' can be challenging. Time-domain astronomy
projects, that require the immediate inspection of challenging volumes of live,
high velocity, complex data, can benefit from citizen science, as shown in these
two recent projects.  While transients such as supernovae or asteroids can often
be found through the use of automatic routines, visual inspection is still used
by many teams as part of the process of selecting candidates for follow-up. 

\todo{Chris}{\#70 Provide citation for ``3 V's'' of big data}

The most successful attempt to use crowd-sourcing to attack these problems to
date has been the offshoot of Galaxy Zoo described in \citet{SmithSN} ``Supernova
Zoo.'' Data from the Palomar Transient Factory \citep{LawPTF} was automatically
processed and images of candidate supernovae uploaded on a nightly basis; this
triggered an email to volunteers who, upon responding were shown the new image,
a reference image and the subtraction between the two. By analyzing the answers
to a series of questions, candidates were sorted into three categories, roughly
corresponding to ``probable supernova,'' ``likely astrophysical but
non-supernova transient'' and ``artifact.'' The results were displayed on a
webpage and used to select targets for follow-up. Despite the site attracting
many fewer classifiers than the main Galaxy Zoo, it was highly effective in
sorting through data, with consensus typically reached on all images within 15
minutes of the initial email being sent. The large dataset generated by this project was used by \citet{Brink} to develop a supervised learning approach to automatic classification for PTF transients. The performance of this routine, which for a false-positive rate of 1\% is more than 90\% complete, depends on the kind of large training set that can be provided by citizen science and suggests a future path for large surveys in which citizen science provides initial, training data followed by machines taking on much of the work. Encouragingly, the routine, which makes use of a set of 42 features extracted from survey images, has performance which is insensitive to a small fraction of mislabeled training data, suggesting that the requirements for accuracy of citizen science projects which aim to calibrate later machine learning may be less stringent than otherwise thought. 


A different approach to time-domain astronomy through citizen science is
exemplified by the Planet Hunters project, which asks volunteers to examine
light curves drawn from the dataset provided by the \emph{Kepler} mission in
order to identify interesting events in retrospect. While the task of
identifying transits from extrasolar planets is, at first glance, one which
seems more suited for automated than for human analysis, the success of Planet
Hunters in identifying more than fifty planet candidates missed by the automatic
routines suggests that there remains a role for inspection by eye in cases where
the relevant science requires completeness of classifications. While several of
the planets found by Planet Hunters, including the project's first confirmed
planet (PH1b, Schwamb et al.), are unusual  -- PH1b, a circumbinary, is the
first planet known in a four-star system --  others, including the more than
forty candidates identified in the habitable zone of their parent star by Ji et
al., might have been expected to be recovered by more conventional searches.
Planet Hunters, therefore, is acting as an independent test of the Kepler
pipeline's efficiency (Schwamb et al.) and has inspired improvements in
subsequent analysis (Bathalia et al.). More recently, advanced users have
participated in the identification of unusual stellar properties - see
XXXXXXXX.

\subsection{Classification Analysis}
\label{sec:class:analysis}

In most visual classification projects, working on archived image data with
little time pressure, the random assignment of task to classifier, followed by
simple, democratic treatment of the classifications has been judged sufficient.
However, the need for rapid processing of images in time domain astronomy
projects has prompted the investigation of more efficient analysis of the
classification data.  Using the supernova project's archive as a test,
\citet{SimpsonEtalIBCC} developed a Bayesian method, IBCC, for assessing
classifier performance; in this view, each classification provides information
both about the subject of the classification and about the classifier
themselves. Classifier performance given subject properties can thus be
predicted and an optimum set of task assignments calculated. For systems
involving tens of thousands of classifiers and perhaps a similar volume of
subjects to be classified, an exact solution is computationally extremely
expensive, but a MCMC approach can be used to find efficient solutions. Work by
Simpson et al., as well as Horvitz et al and Waterhouse on Galaxy Zoo data,
suggests that accuracy can be maintained with as few as 30\% of
classifications. 

This sort of optimization will be increasingly important for online citizen
science, and especially in projects that use a live stream of data, rather than
an archive, since the classification analysis will need to be done in real time.
Analysis strategies which require re-optimisation of the entire subject and
agent model using all past classifications will likely be prohibitively
expensive, and so the focus will need to be on ``progressive'' strategies that
approximate the full inference.

\CaseStudy{Rare event detection: Space Warps} 
Steps towards real-time classification analysis have been taken in the Space
Warps project. Space Warps is a rare object search: volunteers are shown deep
sky survey images and asked to mark features that look as though they are
gravitationally lensed galaxies (Marshall et al, in prep). Extensive training is
provided via an ongoing tutorial that includes simulated lenses and known
non-lenses, and immediate pop-up feedback as to whether these training images
were correctly classified. Because real lenses are rare (appearing once every
$10^{2-4}$ images, depending on the dataset), the primary goal is to reject the
multitude of uninteresting images so that new ones can be inspected -- and this
drives the need for efficiency. Marshall et al (in preparation) derived a
simplified version of the IBCC classification analysis that updates a
probablistic model of both the subjects and the agents that represent the
classifiers in a statistically online manner (Marshall et al, in prep). This
analysis was run daily during each of the Space Warps projects, and subjects
retired from the stream as they crossed a low probability threshold. This
algorithm is being implemented into the web application itself for future
datasets. 

The increased  efficiency of visual classification projects that will come with
real-time analysis will enables feedback on the projects' progress to be given
much more promptly -- an important part of the collaboration between
professionals and amateurs in crowd-sourcing projects.

\subsection{Visual Classification in Other Fields (\textbf{Chris}, Phil, 1 page)}
\label{sec:class:non-astro}

Although, as described in the previous section, astronomical analysis led the
development of citizen science as a data analysis tool, it has quickly been
adopted by other fields. In some cases, this adoption has been explicit. The
tools developed for Stardust@home were developed into a general purpose
library for citizen science, BOSSA, which has recently been ported to python
as PyBOSSA, and the Zooniverse platform which supports many of the examples
described above includes projects from fields as diverse as ecology and
papyrology. This diversity of projects allows general lessons about project
design to be drawn; indeed, this is an active area of research for academic
fields as diverse as computer science, economics and social science. 

\todo{Chris}{\#73 Add citation to Crowston paper on PH and Seafloor Explorer}

Projects from other fields can also suggest strategies which could be adopted
by future astronomical projects. In particular, future projects involving
analysis of survey data which has been collected for a multitude of purposes
may require a more sophisticated model for data analysis than the simple
decision tree presented by projects such as Galaxy Zoo. 

\CaseStudy{Snapshot Serengeti}  This Zooniverse project enables the analysis of
images from more than two hundred motion-sensitive ``camera traps,'' offers a
particularly sophisticated response. Driven in part by the need for an interface
which allows volunteers to state the obvious (for example, identifying
elephants, lion or zebra) and also to provide more obscure classification (for
example, distinguishing between types of gazelle), a variety of classification
paths are presented. In addition to just clicking buttons identifying species,
volunteers can opt for a decision tree-like approach, or choose from a variety
of similar species (``Looks like an antelope...'') or search the descriptions
provided (``Show me all animals whose descriptions involve 'ears' ''). This
hybrid model has proved successful not only in encouraging classification, but
also in encouraging learning; over a Snapshot Serengeti classifier's ``career''
they are increasingly likely to chose more direct routes.

\todo{Chris}{\#43 Move SS to GZ section endnote? Include Snapshot Serengeti citations}

\phil{Is the SS experience relevant to open ended exploration of survey images?
I've wondered for a while whether diagnosis of astronomical image reduction
problems could be done by crowd-sourcing: DES do a lot of visual inspection just
within their team, LSST could serve a larger volume to more people, potentially.
The viewer ubrets with their shareable URLs seem vital for this; might SS-style
interfaces also be important?}

Another aspect of project strategy, and design, relates to the engagement of the
volunteers. The online citizen astronomy projects developed so far have tended
to emphasise co-operation between volunteers, and the results being due to a
team effort. Elsewhere, experiments with a more competitive approach to citizen
science, ``gamifying'' the activity, have been performed.

\CaseStudy{Visual inspection of 3-D biological scans: Eyewire.}  This project,
based at MIT, seeks to supplement machine learning identification of neurons in
three-dimensional scans. Notably, this project incorporated some ``gamified''
elements into its design. Participants in the project, who are asked to identify
connected regions throughout a three-dimensional scan, earn points based on
participation and also have a separate, publicly visible, accuracy score.  In
addition to overall leader boards, the project also runs short challenges
including a regular Friday ``happy hour'' in which participants compete on
specific problems. Eyewire is also notable for its other strong community
elements, with a chat room open and available to all participants in the project
(supplemented, incidentally, by a ``bot'' built by a participant which answers
frequently asked questions from new users).

\section{Data Modelling (4 pages)}
\label{sec:model}

New understanding of the world comes from the interpretation (fitting) of data
with a physical model. Such ``data modelling'' often involves technical
difficulties that computers may find hard to overcome, associated with complex
and/or computationally expensive likelihood functions. Humans, by applying their
developed intuition, can often contribute a great deal to the exploration of a
model's parameter space by closing in quickly on the model configurations that
fit the data well. This process can be particularly satisfying, rather like
solving a puzzle. How have citizen scientists been involved in model making and
data fitting in astronomy, and other fields, to date?

\CaseStudy{The Milky Way Project}
\citet{SimpsonEtal2012} provided volunteers with a fairly flexible set of
annulus-drawing tools, for annotating circularly-symmetric ``bubble'' features
in colour-composite (24.0, 8.0 and  4.5$\mu$m) infrared images from surveys
carried out by the Spitzer space telescope, which are hypothesised to have been
caused by a recently-formed high mass star at the centre of the bubble. The
(bubble) model in this case is simple and recognisable, making both the
interface constructions and its operation relatively straightforward. The large
sample of  bubble models have been used to investigate the possibility of
further star formation being triggered at the bubble surfaces
\citep{KendrewEtal2012}. A subsequent effort \citep{Beaumont} used data provided
by the project to train a machine learning algorithm, \emph{Brut}, in bubble
finding. \emph{Brut} is able to identify a small number of sources which are
excluded from the \citeauthor{SimpsonEtal2012} catalogue, and which are
difficult for humans, specifically bubbles near bright sources which have low
contrast relative to their surroundings. In addition, \emph{Brut} proved
effective at identifying suspect bubbles included in the previous surveys. Given
the relatively small size of the MWP sample, the main use of machine learning is
to contribute an independent check on the data; for larger samples, as discussed
below, an approach in which machine learning trains on citizen science data and
gradually takes over the classification task could be considered. 

\CaseStudy{Modelling Lens Candidates} The Space Warps
project\footnote{\texttt{http://spacewarps.org}} has an informal data modeling
element. The classification interface is restricted to enabling identification
of candidate gravitationally-lensed features, but all the images are available
via the project's discussion forum. A small team of volunteers (including
several citizens who helped design the project) has engaged in modeling the 
identified lens candidates using web-based software developed and supported by
the project science
team.\footnote{\texttt{http://mite.physik.uzh.ch}} Results from a
small test programme show that the model parameters derived by the  ensemble
of citizens are as accurate as those derived by experts \citep{KuengEtal2014}.
A pilot collaborative modeling analysis was carried out and written up by a
small group of Space Warps volunteers\footnote{See
\texttt{http://talk.spacewarps.org/\#/boards/BSW0000006/discussions/DSW00008fr}
for the forum thread that was used.} \citep{Wilcox2014}.

% \todo{Phil}{\#78 Replace SL URL with labs.spacewarps.org.}

\CaseStudy{Galaxy Zoo: Mergers} This has been perhaps the most advanced attempt
at data modeling in  astronomical web-based citizen science
\citep{HolincheckEtal2010,WallinEtal2010}. 
\todo{Chris}{\#49 Check through the merger zoo case study, ensure refs are up to date.} 
Here, simple
N-body simulations of galaxy mergers were performed in a java applet, and the
results selected according to visual similarity to images of galaxy mergers
(previously identified in the Galaxy Zoo project). A key proposal in this
project is that the inspectors of the simulation outputs would be able to find
matches to the data more readily than a computer could, for two reasons. First
is that humans are good at {\it vague} pattern matching: they do not get
distracted by detailed pixel value comparisons but instead have an intuitive
understanding of when one object is ``like'' another. The second is that
initialising a galaxy merger simulation requires a large number of parameters to
be set -- and its this high dimensionality  that makes the space of possible
models hard to explore for a machine. Humans should be able to navigate the
space using their intuition, which is partly physical and partly learned from
experience gained from playing with the system. Initial tests on Arp 86  showed
the crowd converging on a single location in parameter space, and that the
simulated mergers at this location do indeed strongly resemble the Arp 86
system. The authors have since collected thousands of citizen-generated models
for a sample of a large number SDSS merging systems (Holincheck et al, in
preparation).

\CaseStudy{Online Data Challenges}
A very interesting case of citizens being involved in astronomical 
data modelling is that of the analysis challenges organised by members of
the professional astrophysics community. The measurement of weak gravitational
lensing by large scale structure (``cosmic shear'') relies on the measurement
of the shapes of distant, faint galaxies with extreme accuracy. The STEP
\citep{HeymansEtal2006,MasseyEtal2007} and GREAT
\citep{BridleEtal2010,KitchingEtal2012,KitchingEtal2013a} blind galaxy shape
estimation challenges have had an enormous impact on the field, revealing
biases present in existing techniques, and providing a way for researchers
outside the world of professional cosmology to participate. In particular, the
GREAT08 challenge saw very successful entries (including the winner) from two
(out of a total of 11) teams of researchers from outside of astronomy (albeit
still professional researchers). A companion, somewhat streamlined galaxy
shape measurement challenge, ``Mapping Dark Matter,'' which was hosted at the
Kaggle website\footnote{\texttt{http://www.kaggle.com/c/mdm}} 
\citep{KitchingEtal2013b}. The wider reach of this platform led to over 70
teams making over 700 entries to the competition; many of the teams did not
contain professional astronomers, although most were still from academia.

In a comparison with the GREAT challenges, the \citeauthor{KitchingEtal2013b}
found a factor of several improvement in shear accuracy over comparable previous
challenges, and suggested two interesting explanations for this success. First,
the challenge was designed to be as accessible as possible, with an extensive
training set of data that needed very little explanation; in this way the
challenge was geared towards {\it idea generation}. Second, they noted that the
competitive  nature of the challenge (a webpage leaderboard was updated in real
time as entries were submitted) seemed to stimulate the analysts into improving
their submissions. Kaggle offers cash prizes, which will have had some effect as
well (the pot was \$3000 for this challenge, even if indirectly).

Two more astronomical Kaggle challenges have since been set. The first involved
inferring the positions of dark matter halos based on their weak lensing effects
(``Dark Worlds,''\footnote{\texttt{http://www.kaggle.com/c/DarkWorlds}} Harvey
et al, in prep.) This challenge attracted the attention of 357 teams, perhaps
due to its larger prizes. It also sparked some debate in its forums as to the
design of the challenge: the models used to generate the data, the size of the
test datasets (and consequent stability of the leaderboard),  the choice of
leaderboard metric and so on. These issues are also of generic importance for
scientists looking to crowd-source algorithm development. It is interesting to
note that the Kaggle forums are a useful resource for the Kaggle development
team: the citizens who are active there do influence the design of the site
infrastructure and challenge rules (D.~Harvey, priv.~comm.). The most recent
Kaggle astronomy challenge was to reproduce the Galaxy Zoo crowd-sourced galaxy
morphologies, given the same color images. XXX teams entered this challenge ...

\section{Citizen-led Enquiry (3 pages)}
\label{sec:explore}

The previous sections have focused on specific, and isolated, activities in
which citizens have participated. In most cases, the community's involvement has
been a {\it contribution} to a scientific investigation, while not being
involved in the design of that investigation. The most important part of any
scientific investigation is the question at its heart: what is it we are trying
to find out about the universe? In this section we look at some cases where the
process of enquiry, the science, has been instigated or led by citizens.  

In principle, this is an area of great potential. The constraints of funding
proposals and management of research groups can often mean that professional
scientists focus very narrowly on particular topics of research, using a
particular technique for which they become known.  Steering away from this
course implies taking risks with time management, and allocation of resources to
an ultimately fruitless research area can be detrimental to careers.  Citizen
scientists are largely free of these managerial and budgetary constraints, and
are able to devote their attentions to whatever topics interest them: we might
expect outsiders to ask some unusual questions, and make connections and
suggestions that highly focused professionals may not have thought of. What are
some enquiries that citizens have led in astronomy to date, and how have they
been enabled and supported?


\CaseStudy{Saturn Storm Watch.}  In this project, Cassini's observations of
lightning emissions are connected with active amateur observations of
convective cloud structures within the giant planet atmosphere
\citep{Fischer++2011},  and the tracking of the vertices of Saturn's bizarre
north polar hexagon \citep{godfrey88}, a 6-sided planet encircling wave that
has persisted for at least 30 years but that has only recently been observed,
by amateur astronomers.  In the first case, citizen scientists wished to
identify the source of the radio emission detected by Cassini, after being
alerted to them on the Planetary Virtual  Observatory and Laboratory.
\footnote{http://www.pvol.ehu.es} In the latter case, the long-term evolution
of the hexagon vertices is being used to understand what sort of wave this is,
and to identify its origins.


\CaseStudy{The Galaxy Zoo Forum.} The best known serendipitous discovery
emerging from the Galaxy Zoo project is ``Hanny's Voorwerp'' (Lintott et al.), a
galaxy-scale light echo which reveals a recent ($\sim 100000$ years) shutdown of
AGN activity in IC 2497, the neighboring spiral galaxy. The discovery of the
Voorwerp was first recorded in the Galaxy Zoo forum a few weeks after the
project started, and inspired a more systematic search for similar phenomena in
other galaxies. This project, made possible by the deep engagement of Galaxy Zoo
science team member Bill Keel in the forum community, succeeding in finding more
than forty instances of clouds which appear to have been ionized by AGN
activity, in systems a third of which show signs of significant drops in
activity on a timescale of tens of thousands of years. 
\todo{Chris}{\#63 Add more citations for voorwerp science?}

The ability of the Zoo volunteers to carry out their own research, moving far
beyond the mere ``clockwork'' required by the main interface, is best
illustrated by the discovery of the Galaxy Zoo Peas. These small, round and, in
SDSS imaging, green systems are dwarf systems with specific star formation rates
(SFR per unit mass) which are unprecedented in the local Universe, matched only
by high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies. Volunteers not only identified these
systems, but organized a systematic search and further review of them, including
using tools designed by SDSS for professional astronomers to acquire and study
spectral data. 

The discovery of the Peas marked the first time the Galaxy Zoo team realized the
potential of the community of citizen scientists the project had acquired, but
it is important to note that the simpler, initial interaction provided by the
main interface was necessary in order to develop that community in the first
place. The participants in the citizen scientists' investigation of the Peas did
not arrive on the site wanting to dig into spectra or confident of their ability
to do so; these were the results of their participation. The project  acted as
an ``engine of motivation'' in inspiring its participants to become more
involved. 


\CaseStudy{Galaxy Zoo: Quench.} 
Participants in citizen science projects like Galaxy Zoo and Saturn Storm Watch 
are highly motivated but geographically widely distributed; the impact of the
internet in enabling them to find each other and collaborate is remarkable. The
most recent Zooniverse astronomy project, Galaxy Zoo: Quench, is actively
encouraging citizen-led enquiry, by providing flexible tools for investigating
not individual objects but samples of galaxies classified in the main Galaxy Zoo
project. It is an experiment in citizen-driven scientific investigation, and we
await its results with interest.

citizen science, and what motivates them?

\subsection{Demographics}
\label{sec:crowd:demographics}

Who is participating in citizen astronomy? We might expect the demographics to
vary with activity, and with the level of commitment required. We have some
understanding of at least the former division from two studies that were
carried out approximately simultaneously, one of the community  participating
in Galaxy Zoo, and another of the  American Association of Variable Star
Observers (AAVSO).  \citet{Rad++13} surveyed the Galaxy Zoo volunteer
community to investigate their motivations (\Sref{sec:crowd:motivation}
below), via a voluntary online questionnaire. The 11,000 self-selected Galaxy
Zoo users identified as 80\% male, with both genders having an approximately
uniform distribution in age between their mid-twenties and late fifties. The
authors point out that this is close to the US internet user age distribution,
except for slight but significant excesses in numbers of post-50s males,
post-retirement people of both genders, and a deficit in males under 30. The
survey respondents  also tended to be more highly educated than average US
internet users, with most holding at least an undergraduate degree, and around
a quarter having a masters or doctorate. Very similar findings were reported
by \citet{COSMOQUESTsurvey} from a survey of COSMOQUEST project participants.

These findings can be compared with a survey of the members of AAVSO:
\citet{P+P2012} received over 600 responses  (corresponding to about a quarter
of the community of observers and society members). The education levels of
the AAVSO repondents matches the Galaxy Zoo community very closely; the AAVSO
age distribution is more peaked (in the mid fifties), with a similar post-60
decline but also a marked absence of younger people. The online nature of the
Galaxy Zoo project seems to have increased the participation of younger (pre
middle-age) people. Likewise, the Galaxy Zoo gender bias, while itself
extreme, is less so than at AAVSO, where some 92\% of survey respondents were
male. One additional piece of information provided by the AAVSO survey is the
profession of the variable star observers: most (nearly 60\%) of the survey
respondents were found to be working in science, computer science, engineering
and education.

The Galaxy Zoo and AAVSO communities differ by more than just the nature of
their activity. The smaller AAVSO community is arguably more engaged in its
research, in the sense that a larger fraction of its membership is active in
taking observations and contributing to analyses. It would be very interesting
to know how citizen scientist motivation varied with the level of
participation: dividing the Galaxy Zoo community into volunteers that
contribute to the  forum and those who don't could be interesting; perhaps
more so would be to repeat the analysis of \citeauthor{Rad++2013} over a wide
range of projects, and look for trends there. The emergent picture thus far,
however, is of a well-educated (and often scientifically trained)  but
male-dominated citizen science community, whose female and younger membership
is likely to have been, at least in part, enabled via projects being hosted
online. Continuing to lower the barriers to entry for currently
under-represented demographic groups would seem both important, and within
reach.

\subsection{Motivation}
\label{sec:crowd:motivation}

\todo{Chris}{\#45 Read the motivation section to see if it works well for discussing motivation and gamification the way you want to.}

What motivates citizen scientists? The two demographic studies referred to
above also covered this question; it was the primary motivation for
\citeauthor{Rad++2013}. Having previously identified 12 categories of
motivation in an earlier pilot study \citep{Rad++2010}, \citeauthor{Rad++2013}
asked the 170,000 volunteers at the time to comment on how motivated they were
by each of these categories, and which was their primary motivation. The 6\%
who responded gave consistent answers to around 900 forum users who responded
in a separate appeal, allowing us to draw conclusions about this presumably
more engaged sub-population. A desire to {\it contribute} to science was found
to be the dominant primary motivation, being selected by 40\% of respondents.
{\it Astronomy}, {\it science}, {\it vastness}, {\it beauty} and 
{\it discovery} were all motivation categories that were found to very
important to the volunteers, while {\it fun}, {\it learning} and {\it
community} were less important. 

The AAVSO demographic survey \citep{P+P2012} found similar results: over a third
of variable star observers cited involvement in science and research as their
primary source of motivation. However, a similar number gave an interest in
variable stars as theirs, perhaps reflecting a stronger focus on the science
questions involved than is present in the Galaxy Zoo community. Both groups of
citizen scientists are clearly quite serious in their reasons for taking part:
their motivations are actually very close to those of professional scientists,
as many readers of this review will recognize. Perhaps surprisingly, the
participants in online data analysis citizen science projects seem to a large
extent to be a distinct community from those who participate in more traditional
amateur astronomical activities; Galaxy Zoo classifiers, for example, are not
for the most part regular observers. 

While research on the skill, and conceptual understanding, that  people aquire
while participating in citzien science activities is still in its early
stages, there are some hints that continued engagement is correlated with both
performance in the task at hand, and understanding of the physics and
astronomy underlying the task. \citet{Prather++2013} offered Galaxy Zoo and
Moon Zoo volunteers the opportunity to take questionnaires that tested their
understanding of the astrophysics connected to each project, and found that
performance on this questionnaire correlated with high levels of participation
in the projects. In the Space Warps project, the probabilistic model for the
crowd includes a measure of each classifier's skill; a strong correlation is
seen between skill, and both the number of images seen. It seems as though the
skillful classifiers remain engaged in the project for a long time, while
almost no long-term participants have low skill -- an observation consistent
with citizen scientists being motivated by contributing to science.

\subsection{Competition or Collaboration?}
\label{sec:crowd:gamification}

As seen in \Sref{sec:class:non-astro} above, non-astronomical projects may have
much to teach us about ``gamification'' as a motivator -- the inclusion, either
explicitly or implicitly, of game-like mechanics such as scores, ``badges'' or
other rewards, leader boards, and so on. An early experiment with Galaxy Zoo
showed that the addition of a score de-incentivised poor classifiers, but also
resulted in the best classifiers leaving, presumably having been satisfied once
a top score was achieved. A recent study by Eveleigh et al. of the Old Weather
project, which included basic rankings for classifiers, highlighted these
dangers, identifying volunteers who were alienated by the addition of this
game-like score, feeling discouraged when top scores could not be matched, or
worrying about data quality if the scoring scheme rewarded quantity of
classifications rather tham accuracy. Taking seriously the above finding 
that citizen scientists are motivated by a perception of authentic
participation in research, it seems right to be cautious about introducing
elements which are or which are perceived to be in tension with this primary
motivation. 

Furthermore, the introduction of a significant incentivizing scheme relies on an
accurate model of what `correct' behaviour would look like; this may prove a
significant barrier both to accuracy if such a model is not available (for
example, in Planet Hunters such a model would not have included unusual systems
such as PH1b) and, where a strong incentive scheme results in near-uniform
classifier behaviour, a loss of flexibility in later data analysis. 
A strong comparison of the type of reward structure utilized by Eyewire and the
approach used by projects such as Galaxy Zoo is needed, in order to
inform future project design. 

The surveys described in the previous section reveal a community of people many
of whom may have left   academic science behind as soon as they finished their 
education, but who still maintained a passion for astronomy and the  boundaries
of knowledge.  Their thirst for knew information, and the  desire to be part of
the  scientific process drives them to actively observe the  night sky or to
participate in analysis of large datasets.  

For the more motivated people involved in citizen science, being part of a
community,  albeit a distributed one, that brings great enjoyment and
satisfaction.  With the connectivity of the internet, there is a social  aspect
of citizen science that unites people with shared interests.   These pastimes
and hobbies are often far removed from someone's ``normal''  life. However, {\it
community} was not found to be a strong motivator for the Galaxy Zoo volunteers
-- but it is nevertheless very important for the Galaxy Zoo forum users. More
recent Zooniverse projects have sought to widen participation in community
discussion, hypothesizing not that it will motivate people better, but because
it will help them make better contributions. Citizen scientists, like
professional scientists, are primarily motivated by getting science done.

% 1) Preamble: present picture of two communities, working with professionals.
% Concept of niches for citizens. 

Through this review a picture has emerged of two very active and engaged
communities of citizen astronomers, the observers, and the classifiers. 
Although they have come together in differing ways (by self-assembly through
local groups linked by national and international networks, or by joining online
projects built by professional organisations), they have reached a similar
degree of internet-enabled connectedness, both with each other and with the
groups of professional astronomers with whom they are now collaborating, and
share the common motivation of being involved in, and contributing to, science.
In this section we look ahead, to the next decade or so, and discuss the likely
path that citizen astronomy will take, as the available technology advances and
professional astronomy evolves. In it we try to identify the niches that
citizens can best occupy in this changing environment, and also some key
challenges that those planning citizen science projects are likely to have to
face.

% 2) Overview of where professional astronomy is heading. Large surveys: time 
% domain and cosmology to faint limits. Networks of small telescopes, and 
% extremely large telescopes for follow-up. Niches: bright object observing. 
% Survey data mining, as part of human-machine partnership.

In professional astronomy, the wide field survey era is upon us: SDSS provided
the data for Galaxy Zoo, and other, larger surveys are planned or underway. Key
science drivers for projects such as LSST, LOFAR and the Square Kilometer Array
are mapping cosmological structure back into the reionisation era, and  further
opening the time domain, projects that will yield datasets of significantly
increased volume, throughput rates, and complexity.  Follow up observations of
new discoveries made at greater depths will be made with giant facilities such
as ALMA and various planned Extremely Large Telescopes, while distributed arrays
of robotic 1m+ class telescopes, operating in remote regions with excellent
atmospheric conditions, and trained to observe a target in a regular fashion
over multiple nights will be able to take advantage of wealth of new transient
phenomena. 

These future advances in technology may in one sense widen the gap between
citizen scientists and professionals again. For example, networked telescopes
capable of quasi-continuous observations over 24 hours could be used to develop
a consistent high-quality dataset for cloud tracking on Venus, Mars or the giant
planets, or to monitor for meteor showers to permit 3D trajectory
reconstruction.   As the images would be regularised, we could envisage
automated software to track features, detect impacts, identify morphological
peculiarities over time, replacing the crowd-sourced citizen analysis currently
underway.  However, such an investment would require both international funding
and considerable time and effort.

% From Leigh: 

% Today, the crucial benefits of active citizen observing are that of time and
% coverage, enabled by a global network of passionate and talented observers,
% connected and sharing their contributions via the internet.  The professional
% community, restricted to the over-burdened resources of space observatories
% and ground-based facilities, do not have the capability to replace this
% contribution. Furthermore, would we want to?  After all, the close connection
% between professional and amateur communities has broadened the audience for
% scientific discoveries, and allowed us to use astronomy to educate and enthuse
% the next generation of budding citizen scientists.  This two-way highway is a
% key benefit of our present era of citizen astronomy.  However, citizen
% scientists currently do this for fun and education, and professionals should
% be wary of demanding more standardised, calibrated and uniform techniques for
% temporal and spatial monitoring, as enthusiasm may wane if this begins to
% sound like 'work' rather than a hobby.


% ``One might imagine that, as observing technology improves, citizen discoveries
% via active observation might extend out to the distant Kuiper Belt, although
% many of these targets are so dim that they are unavailable to all but the
% largest of apertures.'' 

% \question{Leigh}{So what then is the future of citizen
% discovery in the solar system? Mining of the LSST archive? Will there be an
% active observing aspect to this effort?}

% Reply from Leigh: 
% I would imagine that some citizens would certainly participate in data  mining
% efforts, but I get the impression that this doesn?t capture the  imagination
% in the same way as the active observing does. In the  latter, I expect to see
% improvements in spatial resolution, filter  coverage and sensitivity so that
% amateurs can detect smaller and  smaller features on planetary objects -
% resolving storm systems on  Neptune, for example. I wrote about much of this
% in the ?Pushing  observational boundaries? section. Their main problem will
% be  automated feature detection in planetary movies (such as impact  flashes),
% which comes with a ?big data? problem, given that regular  video monitoring of
% the planets will take up terabytes of data!

% 3) Pushing observational boundaries (Leigh)
% Amateurs' own big data problem, in feature recognition.

% \CaseStudy{Pushing observational boundaries.}
% Amateur observing follows professional:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Deeper field for amateur observations of Uranus and Neptune, particularly
% near-IR.
% \item Visible-light and near-IR spectroscopy; long-term datasets, serious
% photometry.  Calibration, calibration, calibration...
% \item Advanced technologies such as AO for image stabilisation?
% \end{itemize}

However, the advances in hardware becoming available to citizen observers
suggest other roles they could play. Larger optics, more sensitive cameras, and
spectral coverage extending to longer wavelengths in the infrared could permit
citizen investigations of Uranus and Neptune; the cold and icy bodies in the
distant solar system (e.g., Trans-Neptunian objects and the Kuiper Belt), and
asteroids and solar system debris closer to home.  Transits of extrasolar
planets in front of their parent stars would be permitted from modest
observatories provided they had stable conditions.  New platforms might also
become available to the citizen scientist, including balloon-borne observatories
rising up and out of the majority of the atmospheric turbulence to provide
crisper and more detailed observations of astronomical targets. We may well see
networks of citizen deep sky observers investigating new transients found in the
wide field surveys, at least at the bright end. 

Aside from pushing the observational boundaries, one challenge that amateur
astronomy may face is its own big data problem.   For example, solar system
video monitoring projects are likely to need automated feature detection of some
kind; other observing campaigns may also generate more data than is easily
manipulated. Will this community take to crowd-sourcing its visual inspection?

in principle  enable the citizen observers to enlist other citizens to help with
interpreting their observations, no?}

% on progress in machine learning.
% 
% ; if the ``technological singularity'' first described by John von Neumann
% \citep{Ulam}, is imminent then there will be little need for either citizen or
% professional astronomers! A less ambitious astronomical equivalent -- the 

The point at which human review of data is no longer necessary has been forecast
for decades, but as we have seen above, the number of problems for which
manual review of images or data is still carried out is considerable. Even if
the proportion of data for which human inspection is necessary decreases
dramatically over the next decade, the continued growth in the size of
astronomical datasets should ensure that there remains plenty for citizen
scientists to do. 

Consider the example of optical transients. The LSST system
overview paper \citep{LSSTsystem} gives a conservative estimate of $10^5-10^6$
alerts per night. Even if, after automated brokerage, only 1\% of these require
human classification, then that still might produce 10,000 images requiring
inspection every night -- roughly one every 100 seconds. Given the increased
reliability and likelihood of serendipitous discovery provided by review by
citizen scientists, we should take seriously the incorporation of open
inspection into plans for LSST transients. Similar arguments (with large error
bars) can be made for other surveys: review of transients for LOFAR
already requires some human intervention. 


Implicit in this way of thinking is the sharing of work between human and
machine classifiers. 
% Galaxy Zoo and similar projects err instead on the side of including the widest
% possible range of data, in order to make the task of combining classifications
% simpler; once the data volume or rate grows further, this must be sacrificed for
% efficiency's sake. 
A simple example of human-machine task allocation was mentioned in
\Sref{sec:class:analysis}, where machine analysis of PTF images identified those
that contained candidate supernovae needing inspection by volunteers. It is
worth noting that the inclusion of human inspection changed the nature of the
machine learning task; instead of optimising for purity (producing a small but
accurately classified set of candidates), the task for machine learning became
one of identifying a subset of the images which contained many false positives
but also a complete set of all supernovae. 

In this example, human and machine classification proceeded in series rather
than in parallel, but more complex interactions are possible. The accuracy of
machine learning typically depends on the quality of the ``gold standard'' data
which can be provided for the problem in question, and, although citizen science
projects can assist by providing training sets which are orders of magnitude
larger than might otherwise have been available, work by \citet{Banerji}
established that the confidence intervals provided by classifications from
multiple volunteers can also improve accuracy. Predicting human responses (in
the form of probabilities of classification) is an easier task than
straightforward sorting. We expect, therefore, intermediate-size surveys to
benefit in the future from a ``citizen science phase,'' in which data is
classified by volunteers prior to the automation of the task. This pattern has
already been followed by the PTF supernova project discussed above, but perhaps
it is more useful to think of the citizen scientists as providing training sets
on demand, so that as conditions change from night to night, or the performance
of the instrument evolves over time, a small percentage of the total data is
always processed by humans in order to provide a constantly updated training
set. 

This approach is complementary to the work discussed in
\Sref{sec:class:analysis}, which mentioned efforts to improve the efficiency of
classification projects by assigning tasks more efficiently. If we are using
classifications of gold standard data to assess the performance of human
classifiers, it is trivial to include machine classification in the same system.
In this way, the task of classification could be split in real time between
machine and human classifiers. Significant work has already been carried out for
the nearly analogous problem of assigning tasks to an ensemble of imperfect
machine classifiers whose characteristics are known (XXXX REF XXX) and for
Mechanical Turk-like systems where a fixed payment is provided for a task but
the problem of adding in volunteers is significantly harder (XXXX REF XXXX). For
the machine-only case, each classification task can be treated as having a known
cost (perhaps the processing time necessary for a given routine), but when
assigning tasks to  volunteers, who are able to leave whenever they like, other
costs must be taken into account. In order to create a viable system, it is, in
fact, necessary to measure how interesting a task or set of tasks is, and this
requirement may conflict with the need for efficiency. As an example, consider a
Galaxy Zoo-like system which assigned the hardest galaxies to the best
classifiers. This would result in a steady diet of faint fuzzy objects for the
best classifiers; if they are motivated in part by the variety of images seen,
then such a system would tend to systematically drive away its best
classifiers. 

We therefore expect the development of novel systems for task assignment to be
necessary to scale citizen science to the challenges for the next generation of
surveys. Existing data from both Zooniverse and other projects can help
investigate possible schemes, but early experiments suggest that assigning a
``cost'' to a single classification will not be easy. For example, one might
propose that the number of classifications contributed after seeing each image
might be a reasonable measure of the ``cost'' of a classification, with the
expectation that seeing an especially interesting image might prolong a
classification session. For most Zooniverse projects, though, there is little
statistical significance in this measure. A study of Snapshot Serengeti even
revealed that seeing a more impressive image early in a classifier's career (as
measured by the number of volunteers who added it to their list of favourites)
tended to decrease the number of classifications received from that volunteer in
the long run. Considering individual classifications in isolation is clearly not
sufficient; the entirety of a volunteer's career must be considered when
assigning tasks. Put more simply, we should be wary of over-specialisation even
when efficiency is paramount.

As we have seen in previous sections, volunteers can and do also move beyond
simple classification problems, and such behaviour could become increasingly
important as the volume and complexity of astronomical data continues to
increase.

We might imagine providing user-friendly, web-based tools enabling  fairly
sophisticated data analysis to be performed by anyone with a browser. The
experience documented above invites us to consider the possibility of teams of
citizens  performing analyses that currently require a significant amount of
research student time. Checking survey images and catalogs  for processing
failures and fitting non-linear models to data are just two possibilities.

Enabling these advanced activities at the required scale could require the
appearance of a significantly increased cohort of advanced online citizen
scientists, many of whom would need to be fluent in the tools of professional
astronomy. An example of best practice exists in the way that the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey's \emph{sky server} provided tools for both professional (or
advanced) researchers alongside simplified versions aimed primarily at
educational use. This structure has the twin benefits of providing near-seamless
transitions from simple to more advanced interfaces, and of providing extra
pressure to make the resulting interfaces easily usable  (something which
benefits all users, not just citizen scientists!). Designers of science user
interfaces for projects such as LSST would do well to bear these twin audiences
in mind. Indeed, the more citizen-accessible the interfaces to the upcoming
public wide-field survey databases can be made, the better chance we will give
ourselves of enabling and supporting citizen-led enquiry.

% 7) Accessibility, collaboration 

As well as enabling access to the data, citizen science projects looking to
engage larger crowds of volunteers will likely face some other accessibility
challenges. We might expect contributing to science via large international
public datasets to appeal to citizens of many nations: coordinating a scientific
discussion across multiple language barriers could prove difficult. Having a
critical mass of professional scientists interacting in each language would seem
the most important factor. Even within a single language group, collaboration is
difficult to achieve with  very large numbers. The hierarchical system of
citizen discussion  moderators bridging the gap between science teams and the
crowd has worked well in the Zooniverse projects, despite requiring significant
commitment and effort from the volunteer moderators. Access to professional
scientists can be somewhat improved by regular webcasts (as provided, for
example, by the Galaxy Zoo science team); this provides at least partially the
scientific dialogue that is most valuable to the citizen collaborators.
Certainly these can supply much needed feedback as to the utility of the
citizens' efforts, as the professionals report on how the citizen-provided data
is being used. We might imagine regular broadcasts from the projects providing
the data as playing a significant role in motivating and sustaining a crowd of
volunteers.

\section{Concluding Remarks: Characteristics of Successful Citizen Science (1 page)}
\label{sec:conclusions}

\todo{Phil}{\#61 Compose 2-3 paragraphs, or better, an itemized list, of the  characteristics of successful citizen science, drawing from the notes already in place.}

To emerge...

We argue that a critical feature of ``citizen science'' is the enabling of 
amateurs to make authentic contributions to science. 

Uncompromising stance on value of citizen contributions: focus on tasks that
cannot be done by machines or professionals.

Low barrier to entry, easy to make a contribution.

Emphasis on science that volunteer is to be part of. 

Good communication between professionals and citizens.

High level of respect for volunteers: think of citizens as collaborators,
research assistants.

Leigh writes: ``Citizen
scientists currently do this for fun and education, and professionals should
be wary of demanding more standardised, calibrated and uniform techniques for
temporal and spatial monitoring, as enthusiasm may wane if this begins to
sound like 'work' rather than a hobby.''

Provide tools that professionals would want to use -- alternatively, design
professional tools so that any citizen can use them.

The need to understand black box systems -- especially if the box is full of
people. But: people must be treated as ends in themselves. 

% We have dwelt on Galaxy Zoo at length because it allows us to clearly see the

% of scientific value. It enables \emph{serendipity}, giving individual attention
% to each image and allowing the identification of (and advocacy for) systems
% which are literally one in a million such as Hanny's Voorwerp. The large
