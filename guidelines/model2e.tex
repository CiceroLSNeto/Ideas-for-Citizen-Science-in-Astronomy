dedicated here to the unfinished work which they have, thus far, so nobly
carried out. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task
remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased
devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measures of

But in a larger sense we \revise{did not}{cannot} dedicate  we cannot consecrate  we
cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled
here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The
world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here, but can never
forget what they did here. For details visit our

	This may be a little \revise{exagerated}{exaggerated}, but not by much. Is this 
really what research is all about, what you were trained for and 
looked forward to doing with your life? Where is the fun and 
excitement of discovery? Or, God forbid, is this the new definition 
of ``fun"?

It is for us, the living, rather to be

carried out (See Figure~\ref{fig2}). It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task

It is before us that from these honored dead we take increased
devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measures of
devotion  that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have
died in vain. Example of unnumbered equation:-
\[
        A+B= a^4+4a^3b+6a^2b^2 +4ab^3+b^4
\]
and that this government of the people, by the people, for the
people, shall not perish from the earth.
Example of numbered equation (\ref{eq1}):-
\begin{equation}
\int\int_A\int f(x,y,z)\, dx\,dy\,dz
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom; and that
this government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not
perish from the earth. Example of unnumbered group of equations:-

&&{}\int\int_A\int f(x,y,z)\, dx\,dy\,dz\\
&&{}\int\int\int_A\int f(w,x,y,z)\, dw\, dx\,dy\,dz

Example of numbered group of equations (\ref{eq4}):-
